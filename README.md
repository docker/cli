## About

The Docker CLI is the official command-line interface used to interact with the Docker Engine. It provides developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators with a powerful tool to manage containerized applications and resources such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

This CLI is a key component of the Docker platform and is widely used in development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and production systems across various operating systems and architectures.

This repository contains the source code and tooling required to build, test, and contribute to the Docker CLI. It supports cross-compilation, custom builds, and offers a developer-friendly workflow using Docker itself.

## Features

Some of the key features of the Docker CLI include:

-  **Container Lifecycle Management**  
  Create, start, stop, restart, and remove containers with simple commands.

-  **Image Management**  
  Build, pull, push, and inspect Docker images across local and remote registries.

-  **Multi-Platform Builds**  
  Cross-compile and build images for multiple platforms using `buildx`.

-  **Network and Volume Control**  
  Manage container networking, custom bridge networks, and persistent storage volumes.

-  **Inspect and Debug**  
  Use commands like `docker inspect`, `logs`, and `exec` to investigate running containers.

-  **Scriptable and CI/CD Friendly**  
  Seamless integration with CI/CD tools for automated testing, building, and deployment.

-  **Extensive Documentation and Plugin Support**  
  Well-documented CLI commands and support for extensions and custom plugins.

-  **Docker Contexts**  
  Easily switch between different Docker endpoints (e.g., local, remote, cloud).

-  **Secure by Design**  
  Actively maintained with security in mind and part of the OpenSSF Scorecard program.


## Development

`docker/cli` is developed using Docker.

### Build CLI from source:

```shell
docker buildx bake
```

### Build binaries for all supported platforms:

```shell
docker buildx bake cross
```

### Build for a specific platform:

```shell
docker buildx bake --set binary.platform=linux/arm64 
```

### Build dynamic binary for glibc or musl:

```shell
USE_GLIBC=1 docker buildx bake dynbinary 
```

### Run all linting:

```shell
docker buildx bake lint shellcheck
```

### Run test:

```shell
docker buildx bake test
```

### List all the available targets:

```shell
make help
```

### In-container development environment

Start an interactive development environment:

```shell
make -f docker.Makefile shell
```
