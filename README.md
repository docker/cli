docker/cli
==========

This repository is the home of the cli used in the Docker CE and
Docker EE products.

Development
===========

The `./tasks` script allows you to build and develop the cli with Docker.

Build a linux binary:
```
$ ./tasks binary
```

Run all linting:
```
$ ./tasks lint
```

List all the available targets:

```
$ ./tasks help
```

### In-container development environment

Start an interactive development environment:

```
$ ./tasks shell
```

From the interactive development shell you can run tasks defined in the
Makefile. For example, to build a binary you would run:

```
$ make binary
```
