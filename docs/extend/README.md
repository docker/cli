# Docker Plugins

## Getting Started
The other docs within this section of the repo cover the following about plugins:
- Configuration
- Development
- Installation
- Usage

To learn more about plugins provided by Docker, please view the [guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/legacy_plugins/).

## Versions

### V1
V1 is the initial iteration of Docker plugins. Read more about them in [legacy_plugins](docs/extend/legacy_plugins.md).
While V1 is referred to as the legacy plugin system (Docker v1.12 and older), it is still supported in the latest version.

### V2
V2 is part of the roadmap for [Better Plugin Infrastructure](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/20363).
The goal of V2 is for experimental engine-level plugin management. For more
information, please take a look at the following [commit](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/f37117045c5398fd3dca8016ea8ca0cb47e7312b).
V2 is introduced as part of Docker v1.13, introducing V2 as a managed plugin system.

## Design

### V1
TODO: Need documentation regarding architecture to provide accurate information on V1.

### V2
TODO: Need documentation regarding architecture to provide accurate information on V2.

## Contributing
As the project continues to grow, contributions are always welcome. With plugins, any and all
architecture diagrams, and information relevant to the roadmap is beneficial.
