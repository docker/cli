# Description

Working with Docker, docker have various unused objects hanging around from previous activities, so docker
takes a conservative approach to clean up unused objects, part of the object which we would be talking about is the builder cache
these object are stored when building dockerfiles, there're generally not removed unless you explicitly ask Docker to do so. This
can cause Docker to use extra disk space. Docker provides a prune command `docker builder prune` or `docker buildx prune` to clean
up multiple unused build cache at once. This topic shows how to use these prune command and it different inputs to clean build
cache.

When we execute the `$ docker builder prune` command, it makes an API call to the Docker daemon, and the daemon searches for all
unused build cache objects on that host and removes those objects from the system.

The goal of creating cache is to speed up future builds.
Removing unused build cache is very important in docker so as to build effective dockerfiles, pruning removes dead and unused
build cache allowing room for new and useful cache. It also defers bad build cache and promotes the builds to work faster and
effective.
So docker try to remove the cache that is less likely to be used in future builds to keep builds as fast as possible while maintaining cache size under control.

**Note**
>Pruning does not work if the Total is below what you specified as keep storage option to prune. It needs to go above, we are
>going to see how to use the `--keep-storage` option as part of our examples in this topic.

# builder prune

```markdown
Usage:  docker builder prune [OPTIONS]

Remove build cache

Options:
  -a, --all                  Remove all unused build cache, not just dangling ones
      --filter filter        Provide filter values (e.g. 'until=24h')
  -f, --force                Do not prompt for confirmation
      --keep-storage bytes   Amount of disk space to keep for cache
```

# Usage

To see how much cache you are using currently you can use `docker system df` to get a total view for what’s being in use including
containers, images, and build cache.
Our build caches records can be inspected with the following command: `docker system df -v`
(it shows image, container and volume caches)
or with buildx command via: `buildx du --verbose`
with a bit different output.

```bash
$ docker system df -v

Build cache usage: 2.97GB

The [docker builder prune](commandline/builder_prune.md) command line remove all build cache
that are dangling without specifying any of the prune flag [OPTIONS].

```bash

```
As noticed, some dangeling cache are deleted from the record based on the USAGE Status. Does cache record showing 0 usage are not
being used and therefore are been deleted, also if a cache is been shared by two or more images i.e SHARED = true, the cache can 
not be deleted, but we have all the cache in false (they are not being shared). Cache can not be deleted if `USAGE = 0` 
and `SHARED = true` same applies to `USAGE = 1` and `SHARED = false` both of the cache attribute needs to correlate.
i.e `SHARED = false` and `USAGE = 0`.


# Examples

The [docker builder prune --help](commandline/builder_prune.md) shows all the flag / options that can be used for builder prune.
This is what the output looks like:

```bash
$ docker builder prune --help

Usage:  docker builder prune

Remove build cache

Options:
  -a, --all                  Remove all unused build cache, not just dangling ones
      --filter filter        Provide filter values (e.g. 'until=24h')
  -f, --force                Do not prompt for confirmation
      --keep-storage bytes   Amount of disk space to keep for cache
```

# Build Prune With (--force) flag

First of all, the `--force` `-f` flag in [docker builder prune](commandline/builder_prune.md) helps to bypass
the authentication that pops up when we use `docker builder prune` and any of its options. it can be used with other
options, applications and usage examples of `--force` are shown with other options below.

> **Note**
> This feature dose not allow you to force remove a cache that is in use.
> it only bypass authentications.


# Build Prune With (--all, -a) flag 

Builder prune has a flag for removing all unused build cache, not just dangling caches, Discription of this flag is below.
First we check for builder caches:

```bash
$ docker system df -v

Build cache usage: 941.3MB

```
Now we use the `--all, -a` flag.

```bash
$ docker builder prune --all

# A warning notification pops up, that you would need to answer yes or no
# y answers yes to remove all build cache.
# n answers no to decline the removal of build cache.

WARNING! This will remove all build cache. Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
# y was selected i.e delete all cache.

command

$ docker system df -v # to check for build cache

# Build Prune With (--filter) flag 

The filter flag for `builder prune` is used to `filter` what type of filter you want to remove based on the usage time 
i.e the last time it was used, below we will show how the `--filter` flag is been used in our builder prune command.
Command: `docker builder prune --filter unused-for=24h` or `docker builder prune --filter until=24h`

What the command simply say is that remove every builder cache that has not been used for the past 24 hours or
that are not within 24 hours range.

**Note**
> Setting `unused-for` or `until` should be in Hours

$ docker system df -v ## to check the builder cache

# Build Prune With (--keep-storage) flag 

Docker as a way to manage the storage space that build cache can consume. The `--keep-storage` command helps
us to manage the amount of storage space that our build cache can have.

**Note** 
>If build cache as been asigned to only have 1GB of storage, i.e it can only store upto 1GB amount of build caches 
>and if the storage is full, it can no longer store more build caches therefore any other build will not be stored.
>i.e when the prune, it deletes the ones that are unused until it gets to 1GB.

Usage is below:

```bash 
$ docker builder prune --keep-storage 512MB

WARNING! This will remove all dangling build cache. Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

# y (yes) was selected.

Total reclaimed space: 0B

# now let use prune our build cache

$ docker system df -v # to check for builder cache

Build cache usage: 624.5MB
