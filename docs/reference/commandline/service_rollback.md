## Examples

### Roll back to the previous version of a service

Use the `docker service rollback` command to roll back to the previous version
of a service. After executing this command, the service is reverted to the
configuration that was in place before the most recent `docker service update`
command.

The following example creates a service with a single replica, updates the
service to use three replicas, and then rolls back the service to the
previous version, having one replica.

Create a service with a single replica:

```console
$ docker service create --name my-service -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
```

Confirm that the service is running with a single replica:

```console
$ docker service ls

ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          1/1                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
```

Update the service to use three replicas:

```console
$ docker service update --replicas=3 my-service

$ docker service ls

ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          3/3                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
```

Now roll back the service to its previous version, and confirm it is
running a single replica again:

```console
$ docker service rollback my-service

$ docker service ls

ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          1/1                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
```
