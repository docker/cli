docker/licensing
=========

## Overview

*licensing* is a library for interacting with Docker issued product licenses. It facilitates user's authentication to the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com), provides a mechanism for retrieving a user's existing licenses, detects and verifies locally stored licenses, and can be used to provision trial licenses for [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition).
