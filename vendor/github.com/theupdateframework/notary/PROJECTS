# These are the current projects under the overall Notary project umbrella

## Notary

Notary is the original project. It is an implementation of TUF that runs next to a container
registry and adds the ability to sign and verify content in the registry. By default it makes
some different security choices, such as using TOFU by default. As it runs next to a registry
it is not a standard part of the registry protocol and requires independent storage and for
clients to have different code to handle signed content.

## Notation

Notation is a project to add signatures as standard items in the registry ecosystem, and to
build a set of simple tooling for signing and verifying these signatures. This should be
viewed as similar in security to checking git commit signatures, although the signatures are
generic and can be used for additional purposes.

## TUF

TUF is a project to implement the full TUF specification in a registry native way. This may
require upstream TUF spec changes or extensions, as there are some differences between the
registry model and common usage to other TUF use cases. This project will use existing
registry extensions where available but may need its own document types in addition.
